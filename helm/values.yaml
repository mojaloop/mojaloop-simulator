# Default values for mojaloop-simulator.
# This is a YAML-formatted file.
# Declare variables to be passed into your templates.

# Usage:
# Add simulators to the simulators object. The following example will create two simulators,
# 'payerfsp' and 'payeefsp' that will be created with the default values available lower in this
# file.
#
# simulators:
#   payerfsp: {}
#   payeefsp: {}
#
# The default values can be overridden for all sims by modifying mojaloop-simulator.defaults in
# your parent chart. They can also be overriden per-simulator. The following example will result in
# a payerfsp without a cache and a payeefsp with a cache.
#
# simulators:
#   payerfsp:
#     config:
#       cache:
#         enabled: false
#   payeefsp: {}

# TODO & notes:
# * do the port _numbers_ matter at all? Can we get rid of them?
# * factor out these horrible probe configs. Just use k8s defaults by default and allow the user to
#   override.
# * for Mowali, how are JWS and TLS secrets being set up?
# * support arbitrary init containers + config (that might just be config that goes into defaults
#   or something?). Supply all config and volumes to the init containers.
# * create some test containers
# * parametrise imagePullSecretName (global? like https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/redis#parameters)
# * support shared JWS public keys
# * generate JWS private/public keys
# * support mTLS auto-cert generation
# * probably eliminate all config that shouldn't actually be changed by a user, e.g.
#   JWS_VERIFICATION_KEYS_DIRECTORY. That's a good configuration option to have for other contexts,
#   such as running the sim locally or in docker-compose but in this context it's _an
#   implementation detail_. The chart user should not have to worry about it, and we should not
#   have to test the effect of changing it.
# * make ingress more generic- do not preconfigure annotations
# * think about labels a little more carefully- the app should probably always be "mojaloop-simulator"
# * add config map and hashes to the deployments so that a configmap change triggers a rolling
#   update
# * support JWS public keys for other entities. Add a note in the documentation that they must map
#   directly to the value that will be received in the FSPIOP-Source (check this is correct)
# * update labels to be compliant. E.g. app.kubernetes.io/name or whatever
# * rename ".Values.defaults.config" as it's pretty a useless name
# * support arbitrary sidecars?
# * use the redis subchart? https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/redis
#   - this would mean a single instance of redis (probably good)
#   - might need to have the simulators use separate databases per simulator, or prefix all of
#     their keys with their own name, or something
# * allow the user to optionally specify the namespace, with the caveat that that namespace will
#   need to be created manually before the release is deployed
# * should redis be a statefulset? optionally? what does the bitnami chart do?
# * move labels into helpers
# * autogenerate ILP stuff?
# * defaults.resources looks like it's used nowhere- check this and remove it as appropriate
# * look for references to replicaCount in the charts/values. Is it set, or whatever?
# * scale Redis
