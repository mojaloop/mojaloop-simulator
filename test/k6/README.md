# k6 Test Scripts

## Introduction

This project is based on the [k6-example-woocommerce](https://github.com/grafana/k6-example-woocommerce/tree/v2) example.

The template is structured so that:

- Scripts performing HTTP requests and response validation are located in the `scripts` folder
- Scripts denoting the order in which the above should be executed (in other words, "User Journeys") are stored in the `scenarios` folder
- Utility scripts containing generic functions are stored in the `common` folder
- [Options](https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/options/) are loaded from a JSON file

As a result of the above, the entry-point script (executed using the `k6 run index.js` command) only concerns itself with:

- Setting up global variables (typically constants) that as a result become available throughout the rest of the codebase
- Exporting the `options` object loaded from the JSON config file, along with using `Object.assign` to merge it with options provided in the script (best of both worlds)
- Providing the `export` statements needed to run the exported functions in `scenarios` (see the [exec](https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/scenarios/#common-options) property)

## Usage

Please note that the server hosting the site is not scaled for heavy load; the scripts are being provided as working examples. Only run them if you want to see what kind of feedback k6 provides when they are run as part of a test.

1. Install [k6](https://k6.io) (instructions [here](https://k6.io/docs/getting-started/installation/))
2. Clone the repo
3. Navigate to the directory and `k6 run index.js` (make sure k6 is on your PATH)
