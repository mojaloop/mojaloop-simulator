      description: |
        This is a variant based on FSPIOP `PartyIdType` specification.
        Main difference being the CONSENT and THIRD_PARTY_LINK enums.

        Below are the allowed values for the enumeration.
        - MSISDN - An MSISDN (Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory
        Number, that is, the phone number) is used as reference to a participant.
        The MSISDN identifier should be in international format according to the
        [ITU-T E.164 standard](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.164/en).
        Optionally, the MSISDN may be prefixed by a single plus sign, indicating the
        international prefix.
        - EMAIL - An email is used as reference to a
        participant. The format of the email should be according to the informational
        [RFC 3696](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3696).
        - PERSONAL_ID - A personal identifier is used as reference to a participant.
        Examples of personal identification are passport number, birth certificate
        number, and national registration number. The identifier number is added in
        the PartyIdentifier element. The personal identifier type is added in the
        PartySubIdOrType element.
        - BUSINESS - A specific Business (for example, an organization or a company)
        is used as reference to a participant. The BUSINESS identifier can be in any
        format. To make a transaction connected to a specific username or bill number
        in a Business, the PartySubIdOrType element should be used.
        - DEVICE - A specific device (for example, a POS or ATM) ID connected to a
        specific business or organization is used as reference to a Party.
        For referencing a specific device under a specific business or organization,
        use the PartySubIdOrType element.
        - ACCOUNT_ID - A bank account number or FSP account ID should be used as
        reference to a participant. The ACCOUNT_ID identifier can be in any format,
        as formats can greatly differ depending on country and FSP.
        - IBAN - A bank account number or FSP account ID is used as reference to a
        participant. The IBAN identifier can consist of up to 34 alphanumeric
        characters and should be entered without whitespace.
        - ALIAS An alias is used as reference to a participant. The alias should be
        created in the FSP as an alternative reference to an account owner.
        Another example of an alias is a username in the FSP system.
        The ALIAS identifier can be in any format. It is also possible to use the
        PartySubIdOrType element for identifying an account under an Alias defined
        by the PartyIdentifier.

        - PAYMENT - Usually used for performing a transaction from a Consumer to a Merchant or Organization, but could also be for a B2B (Business to Business) payment. The transaction could be online for a purchase in an Internet store, in a physical store where both the Consumer and Business User are present, a bill payment, a donation, and so on.
        - REFUND - Used for performing a refund of transaction.
