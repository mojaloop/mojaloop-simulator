The code in this repo, along with the [Mojaloop SDK Example Scheme Adapter](http://www.github.com/modusbox/mojaloop-sdk-example-scheme-adapter), intends to simulate an exemplary FSP. It is a generic simulator, an implementation of the FSPIOP spec. It is intended to be used both locally, by prospective scheme participants to validate their FSPIOP implementations, and hosted in a cloud to validate a switch implementation. The objective of these use cases is to ease DFSP backend development and integration with the Mojaloop switch.

It is also intended to be used by the Scheme implementing Mojaloop itself to validate prospective participants' implementations before inclusion in the scheme. To these ends, it intends to behave as a stand-alone implementation of the Mojaloop switch, or as a participant in a Mojaloop scheme.

This simulator has two interfaces; the FSPIOP interface for FSP simulation (which is exposed via the Mojaloop SDK Scheme Adapter); and the configuration and control interface (aka Test API). The Test API allows a user to configure the simulator as well as to initiate FSP behaviours, such as quote requests, in order to exercise another FSPIOP implementation.

A diagram showing the logical architecture of the simulator in a test scenario can be found [here](docs/SimulatorArchitecture.jpg)

# Use

## Deploy with Helm and init containers (optional)
Three init containers,
- [onboard-hub-accounts](https://github.com/mojaloop/mojaloop-simulator/tree/master/init/onboard-hub-accounts)
- [onboard-central-ledger](https://github.com/mojaloop/mojaloop-simulator/tree/master/init/onboard-central-ledger)
- [onboard-msisdn-oracle](https://github.com/mojaloop/mojaloop-simulator/tree/master/init/onboard-msisdn-oracle)

are provided for optional use and may make an automated deployment via Helm chart easier than otherwise. Please see the [example](docs/values-sims.example.yaml) config.

## Pre-requisites
  1. docker
  2. docker-compose


## Build
From the `./src` directory:
```bash
docker-compose build
```

## Run (Local)
From the `./src` directory:
```bash
docker-compose up
```


## Configure
A sample simulator configuration is given in the file `\src\.env`.
A sample scheme adapter configuration is given in the file `\local.env`.

Configuration of parties and test execution steps is via...TODO


## APIs
The simulator exposes a Mojaloop API endpoint. An openapi specification can be found here: `./src/simulator/api.yaml`.

The simulator Test API specification can be found here: `./src/test-api/api.yaml`.


## Test API
The test API enables a user to trigger outgoing requests (from the simulator to another Mojaloop API enabled peer) via the `/scenarios` endpoint.

### Finding container IP addresses
```bash
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                         COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES

$ docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' src_sim_1

### Example request

An example request that triggers and confirms an outgoing money transfer using Curl is provided below:

```bash
CONTAINER_NAME=$(docker ps -f ancestor=mojaloop-simulator-backend --format '{{.Names}}')
SIMULATOR_IP=$(docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' "$CONTAINER_NAME")
curl -X POST \
  "http://$SIMULATOR_IP:3003/scenarios" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '[

        },
        "body": {
            "acceptQuote": true
        }
    }
]'
```
